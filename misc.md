# 10/23/17 - Gmail shortcuts
These shortcuts are directly taken from
[this](https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/gmail-keyboard-shortcuts) article.

Comments are my own.

[Here's](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) google's docs.

## In "inbox view"
This is the view that you enter when you first got to gmail.

* `Shift` is supposed to be able to select a range of emails (I couldn't get this
one to work)
* `shift + 8 + u` grabs all of the unread messages
* `e` (with messages selected) archives messages
* `=` (with messages selected) marks messages as important
* `c` drops you into compose mode
* `/` drops you into search mode (just like vim!!)
* and `j` and `k` move up and down your messages like you would expect them to

> I need to figure out how to select a series of messages with j and k without
> having to click anything :)


## Conversation view
This view basically isn't the inbox view and isn't when you're composing a
message.

* `r` allows you to reply to a message
* `a` allows you to reply all to a message
* `f` lets your forward a message
* `shift + u` allows you to mark a message as unread
* `=`, `e`, `a`, `r`, `j`, and `k` work as before
* `n` jumps you to the next message in the thread
* `p` jumps you to the previous message in the thread
* `m` lets you mute the thread
* `u` allows you to go back to inbox view

## Compose view
  * `cmd + shift + k` allows you to drop in a link
  * `cmd + shift + 7/8` drops you into a numbered or ordered list, respectively
  * Tabbing works as it does with every other website :)
  * Bolding, italicizing, and underlining all work as they normally do
  * and `cmd + enter` sends things

## Markdown
I keep forgetting how to make checkmark lists. They go like this:
```
- [ ] This is the first bullet that isn't done yet.
- [ ] This is the second uncompleted bullet.
- [x] This bullet is completed.
- [ ] And this one isn't.
```
Output
- [ ] This is the first bullet that isn't done yet.
- [ ] This is the second uncompleted bullet.
- [x] This bullet is completed.
- [ ] And this one isn't.
