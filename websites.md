Personal lookup table for sites I frequently reference or share.

# Computer Science

## General CS

* [On what every CS person should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/)
  * Good starting point for when you are feeling lazy but want to learn something new.
  * His blog is also solid.
* [Algorithm visualizations](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Algorithms.html)
* [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/)
  * This is _great_ for mindless work. :)
  * I put in a few minutes, ~15 a day when my networking class was boring, and now my typing has gotten quicker and more accurate meaning that I can communicate/work quicker.
  * This was a _solid_ investment in time. Highly recommend.
* [Adam Liter's LaTeX intro](https://github.com/adamliter/latex-workshop)
  * This is aimed at linguists but I reference it a lot.
* [Wiki.c2.com](http://wiki.c2.com/?WelcomeVisitors)
  * More good "mindless" work.
  * Lots of solid articles about best programming practices.
  * It's easy to go reading articles for days here but I usually learn something new here clicking around.

## Linux

* [Learning the command line the hard way](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/appendix-a-cli/ex1.html)
  * I found this helpful when I was learning bash. You have to pay for the full PDF but the entire course is online if you click through each page.
* [Over the wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit1.html)
  * This is fun to work through to try to figure out how to "break into" things without breaking the law :)
  * Also good to learn new linux commands.

## Git

* [A git workflow that looks nice](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)
* [Atlassian's git tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
  * This one made the most sense when I was learning git.
* [Oh sh!t git](http://ohshitgit.com/): Git fixes to common problems.

## Vim

* [A good cheat sheet](https://rumorscity.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/10-Best-VIM-Cheat-Sheet-02.jpg)
  * > I couldn't find the original site for this, sorry!
* [Another good cheat sheet](http://www.glump.net/files/2012/08/vi-vim-cheat-sheet-and-tutorial.pdf)
* [Vim adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
  * I only ever played through the free version but I thought that this was cute.
* And of course there's `vimtutor` that does a great job at going through the basic commands.

## Emacs
* [My emacs tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

# Feminism/Xism

* [Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack](http://antiracistalliance.com/Unpacking.html) of White Privilege.
